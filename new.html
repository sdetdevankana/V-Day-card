        To My Player One,<br>
<br>
You’re like the ultimate combo of brains, resilience, perseverance, cheerfulness and knowledge and I love every bit of it. Whether you're geeking out over tech, conquering games, cruising on your bike, or diving into anime, you inspire me with your energy and curiosity and knowledge.
<br>
<br>
You’re my favorite player in every video game, the hero in my rom-com anime, and the smartest and the most curious person I know. Thank you for being my constant source of inspiration and thanks for being the one who makes my heart race faster than any bike ride ever could.
<br>
<br>
I know I am not the perferct one for you and I am not mature enough to be with you, but you know, I love you the most.
So, I want to ask you, can I be your anime marathon buddy and your adventure partner????<br><br>
Your Player Two,<br>
Bhutu (I like the nickname though)
